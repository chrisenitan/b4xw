A browser extension to prevent unintended closing of an open window when the last tab in the window is closed mistakenly

- [Extension on Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whave/onmmaefeecidiliagmmbelkaeicmaang?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)

## Why

Sometimes you just click the close all or `CTRL W` too fast you end up closing a whole browser window when you don't mean to. This extension makes sure to check with you if the tab in your current window is the last tab you have in that window.

- If it is, you get a default browser prompt asking if you really want to close the tab/window; saving you an unwanted action just incase.

## features

1. Automatically adds an event to each page to check if the tab is the last in the window

## planned

- Allow user to manually add a check before closing any specific tab
- See [issues](https://github.com/chrisenitan/b4xw/issues) list
